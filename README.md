# Food for Survival 
Food for Survival is the Android app and Website for OP Jindal University and nearby dhabas to order food, and snacks.


### Motivation :
We have observed that whether the student is a night owl or an early bird, they cannot quench their hunger, especially during night time. We strongly believe that we need to bridge this gap across all the university campus throughout India irrespective of their location whether they are in cities or outskirts of cities.

In India there are more than *40k universities* and stories are same everywhere. We have a solution for this problem, is to create an online platform in which the buyer and seller come together, majorly operated by students, and to create a self-supporting model.
And for that, we have a working app named as **“Food for Survival”**.


> Also my team wants to build something from our CS programming skill other than solving problems in HackerRank and iterating for loop only.

#### Abstract:
Our work involves developing a reliable platform that can be scalable for implementation to cater the needs of all the occupants of OP Jindal Industrial Park which includes University Students and working class people. As we are in outskirts of Raigarh City, so we don't have any food Delivery Chains available to us. So, we have planned to create a food ordering and delivery system for University Campus and Jindal Colony. This will connect Store, Canteen, local student seller and Complex Store to our University campus occupant.The Scalability and reachability is ensured by using Google Cloud Platform as the preferred Cloud for Backend operation, Storage and Hosting. Our Platform can be accessed by website and Android App user, to order their favorite packed food 24*7 from their prefered food stop like Canteen, Store, Dhaba, or Hostel Store and can pay for it either through Google Pay or Cash on Delivery. After Completion of this project, we can order our food and pay for it digitally from our mobile and desktop.
